Star Wars News Scraper

This is the ReadMe file for my news scraping app program. It was the assignment for the 17th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its called "The Star Wars The Force.net News Scraper" and when it loads it scrapes the top 30 news stories __________its allows the user to input the names of burgers from science fiction (or any burger really) that they'd like to eat, and then eat them.  The created burgers are saved in a Heroku database and their status as eaten or uneaten is saved as well. 

To use it one goes to the Heroku hosted site https://blooming-ravine-90697.herokuapp.com/

Once there one can type in the name of a burger they might like to eat and then hit the "Make Da Burger" button.  This will add the burger to the list of created burgers on left.
