Star Wars News Scraper

This is the ReadMe file for my news scraping app program. It was the assignment for the 17th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its called "The Star Wars The Force.net News Scraper" and when it loads it scrapes the top 30 news stories from www.theforce.net and adds them to its Mongo database.  Each time the page is reloaded it will check the site's current list stories and add any that aren't already in the data base.  

Each story in the database will be displayed on the app's page.  It will show the title, summary, and an active link to the actual story.  By clicking on the story the user can add there own personal notes about that story which can be saved by hitting the "Save Note" button.  This adds the note to a separate but connected Mongo database. To view the not again just select that story.  There is also a "Delete Note" button to remove notes from the database.       

To use it one goes to the Heroku hosted site https://blooming-waters-28751.herokuapp.com/
